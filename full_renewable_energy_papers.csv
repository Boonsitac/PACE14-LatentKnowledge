"The role of hybrid renewable energy systems in covering power shortages in public electricity grid: An economic, environmental and technical optimization analysis","Libya has had a chronic electricity shortage since 2011, which grew to 32.5 % in 2023 and is expected to continue into 2024. The Libyan General Electricity Company was consequently compelled to impose up to eight-hour daily power outages. Challenges in the energy sector's three stages—fuel supply, generation efficiency, and electricity transmission and distribution—are the root causes of this deficit. Decentralizing power generation and switching to renewable energy sources are the main ways to solve this issue. Libya's 25-year strategy (2025–2050) reflects this approach, with the goal of having over 50 % of the country's energy mix come from renewable sources by the end of the plan. Based on existing energy potential maps, this study suggests a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) that combines wind, solar photovoltaic (PV), and pumped hydropower storage (PHS). Because it will assist the national grid in addressing the ongoing electricity shortage, the proposed system is innovative in its design. A multi-criteria decision-making process is used to optimize the sizes of the system's components, taking into account variables like CO2 emissions (ECO2), levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), payback period (PBP), net present value (NPV), and loss of power supply probability (LPSP). Depending on fluid flow rates, the sensitivity analysis reveals that variations in the turbine and pump efficiencies may introduce errors of roughly 8 % in the energy output of the turbine and 5 % in the energy consumption of the pump. Variations in inverter efficiency, however, can be disregarded in the computations because their impact is <0.2 %. The optimal system size for the particular case study in Libya is 762,161 MWh of PHS, 385 MW of wind, and 6000 MW of PV. This HRES produces 12,029,670 MWh of energy annually, which completely makes up the 9,744,033 MWh electricity shortfall. The load directly uses about 41.74 % of the energy produced, with the remaining 39.26 % being stored for later use in the upper reservoir. With a 90 % efficiency rate for the pump/turbine equipment, the remaining 19 % of energy is wasted during the pumping and generation processes."
"A scenario-based modelling for the long-term energy planning based on efficient energy Use, economic and environmental emission reduction on national scale","While Renewable Energies (REs) are not cost-effective in Iran yet, making changes in the structure of the energy system under a long-term energy plan could offer a suitable solution for a more sustainable system. In this paper, energy planning conducted for the case study of Iran. The main goal of this study is to provide a practical solution that can reduce emissions and costs, in addition to meeting the demands of different sectors including electricity, household, transportation, and industry. In this regard, five scenarios designed and analyzed with a focus on the share of REs, the efficiency of power plants, and the capacity of combined cycle power plants. In this modeling, the share of Res including wind and solar in electricity production increased from 0.2 % to 3.3 %. The average efficiency of Iran’s power plants increased from 37 % to 40.5 %, and the share of combined cycle power plants of the total thermal power plants increased from 35 % to 50 % from 2016 to 2050. The results of the cost analysis showed that applying the integrated scenario of REs and combined cycles would be effective in the reduction of total annual cost, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and fossil fuel consumption. The average saved cost by integrated scenario is about $8.7 billion over 30 years compared to the business as usual (BAU). Also, the reduction in fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emission is 294.74 TWh and 65 million tons of CO2, respectively."
Evaluating financial implications of renewable energy for climate action and sustainable development goals ,"The global issue is the urgent need to shift to renewable energy sources to mitigate climate change and sustainable development. China, as the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, is under increasing pressure to transition to renewable energy sources to meet global climate targets, including its commitment to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. This shift is necessary to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy) and SDG 13 (Climate action). Adopting renewable energy presents a number of significant challenges. Therefore, assessing the financial impact of renewable energy adoption is essential for driving climate action and achieving SDGs. This study identified six criteria, twenty-four sub-criteria, and six financial policy strategies for renewable energy development. This study employs fuzzy-based multi-criteria decision-making methods, specifically the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and VIekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR), to analyze and prioritize key criteria and policy strategies in addressing the financial complexities of China's renewable energy transition. The findings of fuzzy AHP highlight financial risk, social benefits, and economic viability as crucial criteria in evaluating the financial implications of renewable energy adoption in China. Besides, the results of fuzzy VIKOR indicate that subsidies and grants, green finance initiatives, and public-private partnerships are the most significant financial policy strategies. This research provides direction for policymakers, investors, and industry stakeholders aiming to align financial sustainability to ensure a sustainable and resilient energy future."
Renewable energy transition and sustainable development,"The mitigation of climate change is essential for sustainable development, and the transition to renewable energy plays a vital role in this process. Policies aimed at promoting the adoption of renewable energy could enhance sustainable development. This study measures sustainable development by using green total factor productivity (GTFP), which captures the capacity to foster economic growth while minimizing resource consumption and reducing pollution and carbon emissions. Using the slacks-based measure (SBM) and global Malmquist-Luenberger (GML) index, we calculate the GTFP index of 281 Chinese prefectures from 2012 to 2022 based on data from the China City Statistical Yearbook. An increase in GTFP indicates higher output with lower emissions from finite resources, thereby signifying the improvement in sustainable development. By conducting a difference-in-differences (DID) design, we investigate the effects of China's Plan on Clean Energy Accommodation (2018–2020) (PCEA) on sustainable development. Our DID estimates show that the PCEA hinders sustainable development. A series of robustness checks reinforce our main findings. Technological progress is the foundation and driving force of sustainable development. Local governments have to invest in infrastructures to promote renewable energy transition, which may crowd out their expenditure on research and innovation and temporarily impede technological progress. However, the shift toward renewable energy contributes to a cleaner energy structure and reduces carbon intensity. Our heterogeneity analyses reveal that southern cities, resource-based cities, and cities with lower stock of human capital are more vulnerable to energy transition, providing valuable implications for regional sustainable development."
The drivers of sustainable development goals in G-7 countries: Navigating the role of climate technology and renewable energy transition,"The Sustainable Development Goals aim to enhance global conditions by addressing social, economic, and environmental dimensions. Understanding the impact of climate technologies and the energy transition on social, economic, and environmental goals is crucial. This study aims to examine the effects of financial innovation (FI), climate technology (CT), and renewable energy (RE) on the environmental, social, and economic objectives of G-7 economies from 2000 to 2022. The study applies first and second-generation econometric approaches to demonstrate the effectiveness of CT and RE on social, economic, and environmental aspects. The findings confirm that financial innovation (FI), climate technologies (CT), and renewable energy (RE) all have significant and positive impacts on social development, as assessed by the Human Development Index (HDI), and economic growth, as indicated by GDP. Furthermore, CT and RE play a crucial role in advancing environmental sustainability by significantly decreasing the ecological footprint (EP) in the G-7 economies. The results were similar and of comparable sizes at the country level, across analysis types (asymmetric analysis), and across different estimators, thereby confirming the robustness of the findings with roots in theoretical frameworks. Conversely, the research suggests a concerning increase in ecological damages associated with financial innovation over the study period. These findings highlight the critical roles of RE and CT in pursuing ecological, social, and economic goals."
The Role of Renewable Energy in Driving Economic Transformation and Sustainable Development in Saudi Arabia,"This study explores the impact of renewable energy on economic transformation and sustainable development. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using the Scopus database, focusing on articles, reviews, and book chapters published between 2014 and 2023. The search employed keywords such as “renewable energy,” “development,” “economy,” and “sustainable development,” with filters applied for language, subject area, geography, and document type. The analysis reveals that adopting renewable energy reduces ecological footprints and greenhouse gas emissions, promoting environmental sustainability. Specific renewable energy sources, particularly wind energy, are identified as effective catalysts for sustainable economic development. The study highlights the role of renewable energy consumption in supporting economic growth, tourism, and GDP growth. The significance of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier, along with its production from renewable sources, is also emphasized. The findings underscore the crucial role of renewable energy technologies in driving economic transformation and sustainable development by enhancing environmental sustainability, stimulating economic growth, creating employment opportunities, and facilitating the transition to a low-carbon economy. However, challenges persist, requiring supportive policies, financial inclusion, and technological advancements to optimize the benefits of renewable energy adoption. Future research should expand geographical coverage, improve data quality, standardize methodologies, explore socio-political dimensions, assess distributional impacts, and promote interdisciplinary collaboration to effectively address the complex challenges associated with renewable energy and economic development."
Towards energy security: Could renewable energy endure uncertainties in the energy market?,"Exploring the pivotal significance of renewable energy is paramount in reducing energy-related uncertainty and enhancing energy security in the U.S. In this research, we employ the wavelet-based quantile-quantile regression (QQR) methodology to capture the dynamic influence of the renewable energy index (REI) on the energy-related uncertainty index (ERUI) under the control of the partisan conflict index (PCI). Quantitative evaluations reveal that, in the short run, REI has negative and positive effects on ERUI. The negative influences indicate that renewable energy could reduce uncertainties in the energy market due to supportive policies; however, REI associated with policy shifts, tech immaturity, and extreme weather would cause increased ERUI. In the medium term, REI mainly negatively impacts ERUI, except within the 0.3–0.5 quantiles, where tech instability, limited market acceptance, and weak policy support raise ERUI. Above 0.5 quantile, these challenges diminish, leading to energy market stabilisation, whereas, below 0.3 quantile, REI's influence diminishes due to its small proportion. In the long term, REI's negative impact on ERUI grows due to advanced tech, consumer awareness, and strong policy support. In the midst of the escalating uncertainties related to energy, we will put forth insightful proposals to enhance energy security in the U.S. by developing renewable energy."
Energy metabolism in health and diseases,"Energy metabolism is indispensable for sustaining physiological functions in living organisms and assumes a pivotal role across physiological and pathological conditions. This review provides an extensive overview of advancements in energy metabolism research, elucidating critical pathways such as glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism, along with their intricate regulatory mechanisms. The homeostatic balance of these processes is crucial; however, in pathological states such as neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune disorders, and cancer, extensive metabolic reprogramming occurs, resulting in impaired glucose metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction, which accelerate disease progression. Recent investigations into key regulatory pathways, including mechanistic target of rapamycin, sirtuins, and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, have considerably deepened our understanding of metabolic dysregulation and opened new avenues for therapeutic innovation. Emerging technologies, such as fluorescent probes, nano-biomaterials, and metabolomic analyses, promise substantial improvements in diagnostic precision. This review critically examines recent advancements and ongoing challenges in metabolism research, emphasizing its potential for precision diagnostics and personalized therapeutic interventions. Future studies should prioritize unraveling the regulatory mechanisms of energy metabolism and the dynamics of intercellular energy interactions. Integrating cutting-edge gene-editing technologies and multi-omics approaches, the development of multi-target pharmaceuticals in synergy with existing therapies such as immunotherapy and dietary interventions could enhance therapeutic efficacy. Personalized metabolic analysis is indispensable for crafting tailored treatment protocols, ultimately providing more accurate medical solutions for patients. This review aims to deepen the understanding and improve the application of energy metabolism to drive innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."
"Integrating Green Finance, Economic Complexity, and Renewable Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia","The primary aim of this research is to conduct a comprehensive examination of the existing theoretical and empirical frameworks concerning green finance, renewable energy, and the economic complexity index, focusing on their roles as central determinants of sustainable development in Asian countries from 1990 to 2023. The study starts with a detailed overview of the pertinent issues, setting the stage for a deeper investigation. It methodically reviews and discusses the relevant literature, extracting key theoretical and empirical insights that contribute significantly to the understanding of these complex relationships. This paper also introduces several dynamic dimensions for future research, aiming to expand and enrich the academic discourse surrounding these topics. It explores the impact of green finance, the economic complexity index, and renewable energy on fostering sustainable development within these nations, attempting to unravel the complex interactions between these factors. The research aims to provide actionable insights that could aid policymakers and stakeholders in enhancing sustainability initiatives. Furthermore, this study makes a significant contribution to the fields of green finance, economic complexity, and sustainable development. It does so by critically analyzing and synthesizing the existing body of knowledge, thereby offering a more integrated perspective that could inform future policies and practices. This comprehensive approach helps bridge gaps in the current literature and suggests pathways through which Asian countries can achieve sustainable development goals effectively."
"How to progress towards sustainable development by leveraging renewable energy sources, technological advances, and human capital","In analyzing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), studies usually examine the environmental dimension, but developing countries must also achieve economic and social development. Against this background, this study analyzes the determinants of the Sustainable Development Index, which considers 17 different SDGs, for the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). The study considers the disaggregated renewable energy consumption (wind, solar, and hydropower), information and communication technologies (ICT) and human capital as control variables and examines their impact on the SDGs for the period 2000–2023. Using the augmented mean group (AMG) and the novel bias-corrected method of moments (BCMM), the study seeks to answer the question of whether renewable energy, human capital or technological progress are effective on the SDGs. The AMG estimator indicate that human capital development, hydropower and ICT contribute to the achievement of the SDGs, while the use of solar and wind energy has no significant impact. The results of the BCMM confirm the results of the AMG. The study recommends that the BRICS countries invest more in ICT and human capital and move towards technologies that increase efficiency in the use of solar and wind energy as key policy options for achieving the SDGs."
Digital Economics,"Digital technology is the representation of information in bits. This technology has reduced the cost of storage, computation, and transmission of data. Research on digital economics examines whether and how digital technology changes economic activity. In this review, we emphasize the reduction in five distinct economic costs associated with digital economic activity: search costs, replication costs, transportation costs, tracking costs, and verification costs."
Empowering smart grid: A comprehensive review of energy storage technology and application with renewable energy integration,"The rapid growth in the usage and development of renewable energy sources in the present day electrical grid mandates the exploitation of energy storage technologies to eradicate the dissimilarities of intermittent power. The energy storage technologies provide support by stabilizing the power production and energy demand. This is achieved by storing excessive or unused energy and supplying to the grid or customers whenever it is required. Further, in future electric grid, energy storage systems can be treated as the main electricity sources. Researchers and industrial experts have worked on various energy storage technologies by integrating different renewable energy resources into energy storage systems. Due to the wide range of developments in energy storage technologies, in this article, authors have considered various types of energy storage technologies, namely battery, thermochemical, thermal, pumped energy storage, compressed air, hydrogen, chemical, magnetic energy storage, and a few others. These energy storage technologies were critically reviewed; categorized and comparative studies have been performed to understand each energy storage system's features, limitations, and advantages. Further, different energy storage system frameworks have been suggested based on its application. Therefore, this paper acts as a guide to the new researchers who work in energy storage technologies. The future scope suggests that researchers shall develop innovative energy storage systems to face challenges in power system networks, to maintain reliability and power quality, as well as to meet the energy demand."
Energy and Human Health,"Energy use is central to human society and provides many health benefits. But each source of energy entails some health risks. This article reviews the health impacts of each major source of energy, focusing on those with major implications for the burden of disease globally. The biggest health impacts accrue to the harvesting and burning of solid fuels, coal and biomass, mainly in the form of occupational health risks and household and general ambient air pollution. Lack of access to clean fuels and electricity in the world's poor households is a particularly serious risk for health. Although energy efficiency brings many benefits, it also entails some health risks, as do renewable energy systems, if not managed carefully. We do not review health impacts of climate change itself, which are due mostly to climate-altering pollutants from energy systems, but do discuss the potential for achieving near-term health cobenefits by reducing certain climate-related emissions."
Energy-Technology Innovation,"Energy-technology innovation (ETI) is the set of processes leading to new or improved energy technologies that can augment energy resources; enhance the quality of energy services; and reduce the economic, environmental, or political costs associated with energy supply and use. Advances achieved through ETI have made large contributions to the improvement of the human condition over the past 100 years. Still more will be required of ETI during the decades ahead if civilization is to succeed in meeting what we believe are the three greatest energy challenges still before it: reducing dependence on oil, drastically upgrading the energy services provided to the world's poor, and providing the energy required to increase and sustain prosperity everywhere without wrecking the global climate with the emissions from fossil-fuel burning. This will require significant enhancements to ETI through deeper analysis of ETI processes, greater investments in ETI, improved innovation policies, and better coordination and partnerships across sectors and countries."
"Energy, the Environment, and Technological Change","Within the field of environmental economics, the role of technological change has received much attention. The long-term nature of many environmental problems, such as climate change, makes understanding the evolution of technology an important part of projecting future impacts. Moreover, in many cases, environmental problems cannot be addressed, or can only be addressed at great cost, using existing technologies. Providing incentives to develop new environmentally friendly technologies then becomes a focus of environmental policy. This chapter reviews the literature on technological change and the environment. Our goals are to introduce technological change economists to how the lessons of the economics of technological change have been applied in the field of environmental economics, and suggest ways in which scholars of technological change could contribute to the field of environmental economics."
The effect of new technology on energy consumption,"This paper uses patent data to estimate the effect of new technologies on energy consumption. Matching energy patent counts to the industries using these patents, I create stocks of energy knowledge for 13 industries. Including the stocks in restricted variable cost functions, I estimate the median present value of long run savings from a new patent to be over US$ 14.5 million. Combining these results with estimates of price-induced innovation, I conclude that two-thirds of the change in energy consumption with respect to a price change is due to simple price-induced factor substitution, while the remaining third results from induced innovation."
Technology and the diffusion of renewable energy,"We consider investment in wind, solar photovoltaic, geothermal, and electricity from biomass and waste across 26 OECD countries from 1991 to 2004. Using the PATSTAT database, we obtain a comprehensive list of patents for each of these technologies throughout the world, which we use to assess the impact of technological change on investment in renewable energy capacity. We consider four alternative methods for counting patents, using two possible filters: weighting patents by patent family size and including only patent applications filed in multiple countries. For each patent count, we create knowledge stocks representing the global technological frontier. We find that technological advances do lead to greater investment, but the effect is small. Investments in other carbon-free energy sources, such as hydropower and nuclear power, serve as substitutes for renewable energy. Comparing the effectiveness of our four patent counts, we find that both using only patents filed in multiple countries and weighting by family size improve the fit of the model."
Renewable Energy Policies and Technological Innovation: Evidence Based on Patent Counts,"This paper examines the effect of environmental policies on technological innovation in the specific case of renewable energy. The analysis is conducted using patent data on a panel of 25 countries over the period 1978–2003. We find that public policy plays a significant role in determining patent applications. Different types of policy instruments are effective for different renewable energy sources. Broad-based policies, such as tradable energy certificates, are more likely to induce innovation on technologies that are close to competitive with fossil fuels. More targeted subsidies, such as feed-in tariffs, are needed to induce innovation on more costly energy technologies, such as solar power."
Sustainable development using renewable energy technology,"This article present a review of the status of research within the exploitation of renewable energy sources with a focus on the status of technologies exploiting renewable energy sources, a status of the assessment of the availability of renewable energy sources and the status on the research into the types of systems, that can integrate renewable energy sources. In terms of technologies and resources, wind and wave power resources, wind technology, geothermal energy, solar heating, cooling and electricity and salinity gradient technologies are reviewed. Lastly, system integration, impacts and environmental performance of energy systems are assessed. The review takes a starting point in work presented at the conference series on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environmental Systems (SDEWES), published in Special Issues in various journals and puts this work into a wider context."
Renewable energy for sustainable development,"This review article addresses the status of research within the application of renewable energy sources. It focuses on the status of renewable technologies, the role of renewable energy sources in meeting sustainable development goals, the status of the research into the sustainability of the renewable energy systems, and finally on the integration of renewable energy technologies in low carbon energy systems. Regarding renewable resources and technologies, wind and wave power resource assessment, heating and cooling, solar energy, renewable energy fuels, and integrated energy systems are reviewed and summarized. The article takes a starting point in work presented at the conference series on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environmental Systems (SDEWES), published in the Renewable Energy journal and puts this work into a broader context."
"Renewable energy, non-renewable energy and sustainable development","The purpose of the present study is to analyse the effects of renewable energy and non-renewable energy on sustainable development. This study is pioneering in this respect because it analyses the effect of renewable energy on adjusted net savings, which is a good sustainable development variable. For this purpose, the data of 40 developed and 73 developing countries were included. According to the estimation results obtained in the study, renewable energy has a positive and statistically significant effect on sustainable development both in developed countries and in developing countries. The impact of renewable energy on sustainable development is greater than the impact of non-renewable energy. In this respect, as the renewable energy amount increases, the level of sustainable development increases. According to these results, the fact that countries use renewable energy more than non-renewable energy sources is extremely important in terms of making progress towards sustainability of development and the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals."
Renewable energy and sustainable development in Turkey,"Achieving solutions to environmental problems that we face today requires long-term potential actions for sustainable development. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be the one of the most efficient and effective solutions. So clean, domestic and renewable energy is commonly accepted as the key for future life for Turkey. Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of these renewable energy sources. Because of this and the fact that it has limited fossil fuel resources, a gradual shift from fossil fuels to renewables seems to be serious and the sole alternative for Turkey. This article presents a review of the present energy situation and sustainability, technical and economical potential of renewable energy sources and future policies for the energy sector in Turkey. Also, potential solutions to current environmental problems are identified along with renewable energy technologies. Throughout the paper several problems relating to renewable energy sources, environment and sustainable development are discussed from both current and future perspectives. The renewable energy potential of the country and their present use are evaluated here based on the available data. The present study shows that there is an important potential for renewables in Turkey."
How do ICT and renewable energy impact sustainable development?,"This study aims to analyze whether information and communication technology (ICT) and renewable energy (RE) can assist in enhancing environmental quality. This study employs time series data from 1990 to 2019 using econometric techniques. The results show that the use of ICTs in the US, UK, China, Russia, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, and Italy has decreased environmental protection. The results reveal that RE use enhances the sustainability of the environment regardless of the sample size or surrogate utilized for ICT. Impulse response functions show that, on average, the influence of ICT and RE lasts between one and seven years. The error correction model segmentation study verified that ICT and RE contribute to the volatility of carbon dioxide emissions. There is strong evidence that carbon dioxide emissions, ICT, and RE use have a bidirectional causal relationship in most circumstances. Several ICTs and RE strategies have been established and explored to profit from the possible positive influence of ICT and RE usage on environmental quality."
Advances in renewable energy for sustainable development,"This article examines some of the latest findings in the exploitation of renewable energy sources (RES) for sustainable development. It outlines some of the latest findings at the system level – e.g., local systems, community systems, and assemblies of buildings – as well as some of the main components in future renewable energy systems. This includes solar technologies, where particular attention is given to the cooling of photovoltaic panels to improve conversion efficiency. Hydrogen – in one way or the other – will play a role as a storage medium or as a means of electrifying otherwise hard-to-electrify sectors. Bioenergy is a valuable but restricted source in the energy system, hence different processes are investigated to optimize the use of different biomass waste streams. Lastly, wind power is addressed as one of the key constituents of future renewable energy-based energy systems. In this special issue, the focus, however, is on the end-of-life handling of turbine blades."
Renewable Energy and Sustainable Development,"Regardless of the enormous benefits of hydropower energy sources in West Africa, there are other renewable sources such as solar and wind that have not been sufficiently tapped for power generation. This chapter discusses the need to integrate the various renewable energy (RE) technologies to meet the ever-increasing demand in West Africa. For affordable, reliable, sustainable, modern energy for all and climate change mitigation and the reduction of environmental and health impacts that happens to be part of the goals of sustainable development, there is the need to devise other ways of producing energy to meet the current rate of demand growth. As the conventional sources for power generation reach their peaks, RE technologies are the hope for West Africa and the world at large. The theoretical and technical potentials of the various RE technologies have been reviewed in this chapter. Average solar radiation across the West Africa subregion is estimated to be between 5 and 6 kWh/m2/day. Mauritania and Niger for instance have the best solar radiation resources among the West African countries ranging from 5.65 to 6.68 kWh/m2/day and 5.69–6.73 kWh/m2/day, respectively. The potential of wind and other RE technologies has also been reviewed in this chapter. Even though West Africa has the potential for RE technologies, the variability of their resources poses a threat to energy security. The cost of RE technologies is also another barrier that impedes the smooth integration of RE technologies for sustainable development. The connection between renewable energy and sustainable development as well as policy recommendations and the way forward to combat the barriers to RE technologies have been discussed."
Renewable energy for sustainable development in Africa: a review,"Renewable energy usage in Africa has been reviewed using South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria and Mali as case studies. The various national energy policies of these countries were analysed and areas that require attention to achieve sustainability were highlighted. On the overall, the success of sustainable development in Africa lies in addressing the imminent energy crisis in the continent. Excessive usage of fuel wood is already creating considerable environmental problems especially in the Sahel. Africa has all the potentials to solve its energy problems if appropriate infrastructural support can be provided for harnessing the abundant renewable resources in the continent, and if skills are pooled together and experiences shared in addressing the key issues."
Renewable energy and sustainable development: a crucial review,"Achieving solutions to environmental problems that we face today requires long-term potential actions for sustainable development. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be the one of the most efficient and effective solutions. That is why there is an intimate connection between renewable energy and sustainable development. Anticipated patterns of future energy use and consequent environmental impacts (focussing on acid precipitation, stratospheric ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect) are comprehensively discussed in this paper. Also, potential solutions to current environmental problems are identified along with renewable energy technologies. The relations between renewable energy and sustainable development are described with practical cases, and an illustrative example is presented. Throughout the paper several issues relating to renewable energy, environment and sustainable development are examined from both current and future perspectives. It is believed that the conclusions and recommendations drawn in the present study will be useful to energy scientists and engineers and policy makers."
On the economics of renewable energy sources,"With the global expansion of renewable energy (RE) technologies, the provision of optimal RE policy packages becomes an important task. We review pivotal aspects regarding the economics of renewables that are relevant to the design of an optimal RE policy, many of which are to date unresolved. We do so from three interrelated perspectives that a meaningful public policy framework for inquiry must take into account. First, we explore different social objectives justifying the deployment of RE technologies and review model-based estimates of the economic potential of RE technologies, i.e. their socially optimal deployment level. Second, we address pivotal market failures that arise in the course of implementing the economic potential of RE sources in decentralized markets. Third, we discuss multiple policy instruments curing these market failures. Our framework reveals the requirements for an assessment of the relevant options for real-world decision makers in the field of RE policies. This review makes it clear that there are remaining white areas on the knowledge map concerning consistent and socially optimal RE policies."
Renewable energy consumption–economic growth nexus in Turkey,"This paper examines the renewable energy consumption–economic growth causality nexus in Turkey. Studies in the literature can be grouped as country-specific and multi-country studies. The results of these studies are inconsistent, and there is no agreement on the existence or the direction of causality between renewable energy consumption and economic growth. The results of this country-specific study support conservation hypothesis. The results of empirical tests from ARDL approach show that renewable energy consumption has a negative impact on economic growth, and the ones of Toda–Yamamoto causality tests show that there is a unidirectional causality running from economic growth to renewable energy consumption."
Reflections—The Economics of Renewable Energy in the United States,"Greater use of renewable energy is seen as a key component of any move to combat climate change, and is being aggressively promoted as such by the new U.S. administration. Yet there has been little economic analysis of renewable energy. This article surveys the literature on the economics of renewable energy and adds to it. The conclusion is that the main renewables face a major problem because of their intermittency (the wind doesn't always blow nor does the sun always shine) and that this has not been adequately factored into discussions of their potential. Without new storage technologies that can overcome this intermittency problem, much of the decarbonization of the economy will have to come from nuclear, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and energy efficiency, with geothermal and biofuels making small contributions. Nuclear and CCS are not without their problems. New energy storage technologies could greatly increase the role of renewables, but none are currently in sight."
Global challenges in energy,"Environmental and security concerns are stimulating global interest in hydrogen power, renewable energy, and advanced transportation technologies, but no significant movement away from oil and a carbon-based world economy is expected soon. Over the longer-term, however, a transition from fossil fuels to a non-carbon-based economy will likely occur, affecting the type of environment future generations may encounter. Key challenges will face the world's energy industry over the next few decades to ensure a smooth transition—challenges which will require government and industry solutions beginning as early as today. This paper identifies four critical challenges in energy and the choices which will have to be made on how best to confront growing pollution caused by fossil fuels and how to facilitate an eventual revolutionary-like transition to a non-carbon-based global economy."
21st Century’s energy: Hydrogen energy system,"Fossil fuels (i.e., petroleum, natural gas and coal), which meet most of the world’s energy demand today, are being depleted fast. Also, their combustion products are causing the global problems, such as the greenhouse effect, ozone layer depletion, acid rains and pollution, which are posing great danger for our environment and eventually for the life in our planet. Many engineers and scientists agree that the solution to these global problems would be to replace the existing fossil fuel system by the hydrogen energy system. Hydrogen is a very efficient and clean fuel. Its combustion will produce no greenhouse gases, no ozone layer depleting chemicals, little or no acid rain ingredients and pollution. Hydrogen, produced from renewable energy (e.g., solar) sources, would result in a permanent energy system, which we would never have to change. However, there are other energy systems proposed for the post-petroleum era, such as a synthetic fossil fuel system. In this system, synthetic gasoline and synthetic natural gas will be produced using abundant deposits of coal. In a way, this will ensure the continuation of the present fossil fuel system. The two possible energy systems for the post-fossil fuel era (i.e., the solar-hydrogen energy system and the synthetic fossil fuel system) are compared with the present fossil fuel system by taking into consideration production costs, environmental damages and utilization efficiencies. The results indicate that the solar-hydrogen energy system is the best energy system to ascertain a sustainable future, and it should replace the fossil fuel system before the end of the 21st century."
