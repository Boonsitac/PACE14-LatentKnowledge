1,Predicting Sports Injuries with Wearable Technology and Data Analysis,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10796-020-10018-3,2021,A Zadeh,"Injuries resulting from sports and physical activities can be persistent and pose a substantial problem for player’s economic wellbeing and quality of life. Wearable technologies in conjunction with analytics can help mitigate the risk to players by identifying injury risk factors and focusing on risk reduction. Prior to engaging in strenuous sport activities, wearables can be employed to facilitate the quantification of relevant functional capabilities, ultimately advancing the field of sports injury management. In this paper, we discuss how wearable technologies can improve the health and athletic performance of athletes by monitoring participants across many variables. A cohort of 54 army ROTC cadets participated in this study. Using Zephyr BioHarness Wearable technology, we gathered quantifiable data to generate insights that allow us to predict and prevent injuries related the wearer’s physical exertion during sporting activities. This study finds that a combination of high BMI and high mechanical loads could result in injury. Therefore, in creating an exercise program, it is imperative to ensure that mechanical load is incrementally increased through the practice season as athletes become conditioned. While, a high level repetitious mechanical load with unconditioned athletes could cause injuries in short time, it is important to impose enough mechanical loads in the training program to ensure good musculoskeletal development. While our analyses identified several factors associated with injury data during ROTC activities, other wearable variables might become significant in other situations. In summary, results from this study demonstrate that wearable technology allows players with an increased risk of injury to be identified and targeted for intervention."

3,The use of wearable technology as an assessment tool to identify between-limb differences during functional tasks following ACL reconstruction. A scoping review,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1466853X22000049,2022,Joao B. Marques Sean Mc Auliffe Athol Thomson Vasileios Sideris Paulo Santiago Paul J. Read,"Objective - To report how wearable sensors have been used to identify between-limb deficits during functional tasks following ACL reconstruction and critically examine the methods used Methods - We performed a scoping review of studies including participants with ACL reconstruction as the primary surgical procedure, who were assessed using wearable sensors during functional movement tasks (e.g., balance, walking or running, jumping and landing) at all postsurgical time frames. Results - Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority examined jumping-landing tasks and reported kinematic and kinetic differences between limbs (involved vs. unninvolved) and groups (injured vs. controls). Excellent reliability and moderate-strong agreement with laboratory protocols was indicated, with IMU sensors providing an accurate estimation of kinetics, but the number of studies and range of tasks used were limited. Methodological differences were present including, sensor placement, sampling rate, time post-surgery and type of assessment which appear to affect the outcome.Conclusions - Wearable sensors consistently identified between-limb and group deficits following ACL reconstruction. Preliminary evidence suggests these technologies could be used to monitor knee function during rehabilitation, but further research is needed including, validation against criterion measures. Practitioners should also consider how the methods used can affect the accuracy of the outcome."

6,Wearable inertial sensors and pressure MAT detect risk factors associated with ACL graft failure that are not possible with traditional return to sport assessments,2019,Michael J Dan,"Introduction Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is associated with poor return to sport and high graft re-rupture rates. This study explored the use of a wearable inertial sensor (ViMove) that incorporates an accelerometer and gyroscope, and MatScan pressure sensing mat (TekScan, South Boston, Massachusetts, USA) to provide objective return-to-sport measures. Methods Three cohorts’ ACLR patients, non-athletic controls and elite athletes (Australian seven’s rugby Olympic Gold medallist). Patients performed biometric and functional tests (thigh circumference and triple hop) and the ViMove knee module (consisting of single and double leg squats, hops and box drops) for lower limb alignment assessment, concurrently with force plate. Results Elite athletes had less varus/valgus (VV) movement during ViMove exercises compared with the ACLR cohort, who in turn had less VV malalignment than controls. When analysing side-to-side differences, single leg squats and box drop were asymmetrical in the ACL group, with greater malalignment in the reconstructed leg (p<0.05). Subgroup analysis failed to differentiate who passed or failed current return to sport assessment. TekScan pressure plate detected differences in double leg landing and flight time while hopping not detected with ViMove, suggesting ACL patients compensate by offloading the reconstructed leg to improve coronal alignment during double leg activity. Conclusion The inertial sensor detected differences in motion for patients following ACLR, which are known to be associated with graft rupture and were not detected with functional return to sport testing. Coupling the device with data from a pressure plate provides a powerful assessment tool detecting alignment differences known to be associate with graft failure only previously detected in formal gait analysis."
7,A scoping review of portable sensing for out-of-lab anterior cruciate ligament injury prevention and rehabilitation,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369366037_A_scoping_review_of_portable_sensing_for_out-of-lab_anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury_prevention_and_rehabilitation,2023,Tian Tan Anthony A Gatti Bingfei Fan,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and ACL reconstruction (ACLR) surgery are common. Laboratory-based biomechanical assessment can evaluate ACL injury risk and rehabilitation progress after ACLR; however, lab-based measurements are expensive and inaccessible to most people. Portable sensors such as wearables and cameras can be deployed during sporting activities, in clinics, and in patient homes. Although many portable sensing approaches have demonstrated promising results during various assessments related to ACL injury, they have not yet been widely adopted as tools for out-of-lab assessment. The purpose of this review is to summarize research on out-of-lab portable sensing applied to ACL and ACLR and offer our perspectives on new opportunities for future research and development. We identified 49 original research articles on out-of-lab ACL-related assessment; the most common sensing modalities were inertial measurement units, depth cameras, and RGB cameras. The studies combined portable sensors with direct feature extraction, physics-based modeling, or machine learning to estimate a range of biomechanical parameters (e.g., knee kinematics and kinetics) during jump-landing tasks, cutting, squats, and gait. Many of the reviewed studies depict proof-of-concept methods for potential future clinical applications including ACL injury risk screening, injury prevention training, and rehabilitation assessment. By synthesizing these results, we describe important opportunities that exist for clinical validation of existing approaches, using sophisticated modeling techniques, standardization of data collection, and creation of large benchmark datasets. If successful, these advances will enable widespread use of portable-sensing approaches to identify ACL injury risk factors, mitigate high-risk movements prior to injury, and optimize rehabilitation paradigms."
8,Exploring the Role of Wearable Technology in Sport Kinematics and Kinetics: A Systematic Review,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/7/1597,2019,Yewande Adesida Enrica Papi,"The aim of this review was to understand the use of wearable technology in sport in order to enhance performance and prevent injury. Understanding sports biomechanics is important for injury prevention and performance enhancement and is traditionally assessed using optical motion capture. However, such approaches are limited by capture volume restricting assessment to a laboratory environment, a factor that can be overcome by wearable technology. A systematic search was carried out across seven databases where wearable technology was employed to assess kinetic and kinematic variables in sport. Articles were excluded if they focused on sensor design and did not measure kinetic or kinematic variables or apply the technology on targeted participants. A total of 33 articles were included for full-text analysis where participants took part in a sport and performed dynamic movements relating to performance monitored by wearable technologies. Inertial measurement units, flex sensors and magnetic field and angular rate sensors were among the devices used in over 15 sports to quantify motion. Wearable technology usage is still in an exploratory phase, but there is potential for this technology to positively influence coaching practice and athletes’ technique."
9,Runners’ Perspectives on ‘Smart’ Wearable Technology and Its Use for Preventing Injury,https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2019.1597575,2019,Christian A. Clermont,"Understanding the user experience between runners and wearable technology is crucial for designing personalized and effective wearable technology features for injury prevention. Therefore, the overall objective of this study was to understand the attitudes and beliefs for competitive and recreational runners towards wearable technology as well as its potential use for preventing injury. Survey data were drawn from 663 respondents. Competitive runners preferred GPS running watches and were interested in tracking personalized data to optimize running efficiency, whereas recreational runners used mobile phones/apps and wristband activity trackers to increase motivation. All runners believed that basic metrics found in wearable technology were most important for injury prevention; however, more advanced metrics had little importance. This paper illustrates the importance of understanding different user experiences for recreational and competitive runners in relation to wearable technology, and encourages the human-computer interaction research community to identify methods in personalizing complex running-related wearable technology data."
10,On Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Prevention: Utilizing Wearable Sensors to Track Potential High-Risk Knee Kinematics and Kinetics,https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/177475,2023,Ajdaroski Mirel,"Participation in competitive sports is on the rise, and along with this comes an increase in sports-related injuries. While these injuries can happen to any part of the body, some of the most common are lower limb injuries, particularly to ligaments, with one of the most common being the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Within this work, we examined soft tissue overuse injury mechanisms using a novel tool for identifying potentially injurious loading cycles that occur in adolescent athletes (predominantly female athletes) with the long-term goal of prevention of this unintentional injury. We used a commercially available inertial measurement units (IMUs) to develop post-collection equations that could accurately and reliably estimate ground reaction force, knee moments, and knee angles; each a crucial factor in determining potential ACL injury. We partitioned this study into two distinct stages, each with specific purposes and goals. In the first stage, we used in vitro models to estimate our required metrics. Here, we used two IMUs and machine learning algorithms and compared the estimates to values measured by a motion capture and load cell system. We determined that the equations could estimate ground reaction force, knee moments, and knee angles with moderate accuracy and reliability. We additionally found that a tuned quaternion conversion method provided more accurate knee angle measurements than a commercially available sensor fusion algorithm. These findings allowed us to proceed to the second stage, human subject testing, where we developed modifications to the first-stage equations. Here we used four IMUs (two on each limb), the models developed in the first stage, and machine learning to construct a modified model; we then compared the estimates for these modified models to measurements of a motion capture system and force plate measurements. These modified models could estimate metrics with moderate accuracy; however, the knee moment reliability was not satisfactory. We then developed a confusion matrix to examine if these estimates could distinguish between low-risk and potentially damaging events, and results showed high classification accuracy, precision, specificity, and sensitivity. We also adjusted the quaternion conversion method for human subject use and found the tuned algorithm provided more accurate and reliable knee angle measurements. Our results show the potential of IMUs for tracking gameplay events and distinguishing between low-risk and potential-risk events. While we acknowledged several limitations within our work, we ultimately believe that IMUs may be able to aid coaches and sports physicians in preventing some athletes from sustaining ACL injuries."
