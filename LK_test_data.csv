1,Predicting Sports Injuries with Wearable Technology and Data Analysis,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10796-020-10018-3,2021,A Zadeh,Injuries resulting from sports and physical activities can be persistent and pose a substantial problem for player’s economic wellbeing and quality of life. Wearable technologies in conjunction with analytics can help mitigate the risk to players by identifying injury risk factors and focusing on risk reduction. Prior to engaging in strenuous sport activities, wearables can be employed to facilitate the quantification of relevant functional capabilities, ultimately advancing the field of sports injury management. In this paper, we discuss how wearable technologies can improve the health and athletic performance of athletes by monitoring participants across many variables. A cohort of 54 army ROTC cadets participated in this study. Using Zephyr BioHarness Wearable technology, we gathered quantifiable data to generate insights that allow us to predict and prevent injuries related the wearer’s physical exertion during sporting activities. This study finds that a combination of high BMI and high mechanical loads could result in injury. Therefore, in creating an exercise program, it is imperative to ensure that mechanical load is incrementally increased through the practice season as athletes become conditioned. While, a high level repetitious mechanical load with unconditioned athletes could cause injuries in short time, it is important to impose enough mechanical loads in the training program to ensure good musculoskeletal development. While our analyses identified several factors associated with injury data during ROTC activities, other wearable variables might become significant in other situations. In summary, results from this study demonstrate that wearable technology allows players with an increased risk of injury to be identified and targeted for intervention.
2,From data to action: a scoping review of wearable technologies and biomechanical assessments informing injury prevention strategies in sport,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13102-023-00783-4,2023,André Rebelo Diogo V. Martinho, João Valente-dos-Santos Manuel J. Coelho-e-Silva & Diogo S. Teixeira,Background-The purpose of this scoping review was to evaluate the current use of technologies in sports settings for training adaptation and injury prevention. The review aimed to map the existing literature, identify key concepts and themes, and highlight gaps in research, thus offering guidance for future studies.Methods-This study followed the guidelines of the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews and a search in four major databases was conducted.ResultsA total of 21 studies were included. The findings highlighted the widespread use of various technologies, including wearable devices and force plates, to monitor athletes’ performance and inform evidence-based decision-making in training and injury prevention. Variables such as Player Load, changes of direction, and acute chronic workload ratio were identified as key metrics in injury prediction.Conclusions-This review uncovers a dynamic field of research in athlete injury prevention, emphasizing the extensive use of varied technologies. A key finding is the pivotal role of Player Load data, which offers nuanced insights for customizing training loads according to sport-specific demands, player positions, and the physical requirements of various activities. Additionally, the review sheds light on the utility of tools like force plates in assessing fatigue, aiding recovery, and steering injury rehabilitation, particularly in sports prone to knee and ankle injuries. These insights not only enhance our understanding of injury prevention but also provide a strategic direction for future research, aiming to boost athlete safety, performance, and career longevity.
